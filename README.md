# Sources-of-Strength-Implementation-Codebook
To make SoS data public to all people who might be interested, we are planning to transfer the data to UNC Dataverse which requires a codebook that briefs the overview of the dataset.


Project Overview 

Data are from a cluster randomized trial of the Sources of Strength program in 20 high schools. The intervention condition contained 11 high schools and the waitlist control condition contained 9 high schools. Sources of Strength (https://sourcesofstrength.org/) is a universal preventive intervention that prepares student opinion leaders (called Peer Leaders [PL]) to modify social-ecological protective factors, including healthy bonds to adults, within their schools and social networks. The Sources program involves three phases: (1) School and community preparation, (2) PL recruitment and training, and (3) School-wide prevention campaigns. 


Dataset Overview 

The School Climate Survey dataset contains responses from 2676 teachers, administrators, and staff in 20 schools across four data collection points (Fall 2017 â€“ Spring 2019). This codebook provides a list and description of the original variables in the dataset.
